# Emulator for Data Sending Test

This folder contains a simple emulator to test if data is being sent correctly to the backend or other services.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the emulator:

   node index.js
   ```

Edit `index.js` to customize the data payload and sending logic as needed.
